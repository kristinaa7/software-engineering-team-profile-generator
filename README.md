# software-engineering-team-profile-generator

## Description
I have created a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each individual.
The goal of this assignment is to practice writing unit tests and testing code to ensure it passes all of them

## Usage
In the integrated terminal, please type ```npm install``` to install the the Inquirer package on your local device. To load the prompt questions, please type ```node index.js'```. To run the test, please run ```npm run test```

## Packages Needed
Inquirer verion 8.2.4 - https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4
Jest - https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest
(added Jest in package.json under script tests)
Bootstrap

To submit the assignment:

This application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
