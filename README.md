# Software Engineering Team Profile Generator
UW Full Stack Bootcamp Module 10

## Description
I have created a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each individual.
The goal of this assignment is to practice writing unit tests and testing code to ensure it passes all of them.

## Usage
In the integrated terminal, please type ```npm install``` to install the the Inquirer package on your local device. To load the prompt questions, please type ```node index.js```. To run the test, please run ```npm run test```.

## Packages Needed
1) NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/
2) Inquirer - https://www.npmjs.com/https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer
3) Jest - https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest
(added Jest in package.json under script tests)
